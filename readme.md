#Postfix Compiler
A quick and dirty compiler for floating point postfix expressions to Java bytecode.

Source files end with .postfix, output is standard Java .class files.

This project is tiny and actually terrible, as it's intended as to be a way to learn how Java class files are structured and how to manipulate them using the Bytecode Engineering Library in Apache commons. It's probably broken in more than one way.
